- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BarrecaMarco and I am a PhD student in Converging Technologies for Biomolecular Systems (TecSBi) at University of Milano-Bicocca.
  I'm working on PhD project named "Multidimensional data integration to capture intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms driving treatment benefit in breast cancer"  which has the aim to identify biomarkers of responce or resistance to neoadjuvant treatment.
  I graduated in Biotechnology (L-02) in 2019 and I achieved the masterâ€™s degree in Industrial Biotechnology (LM-08) in 2021 with full marks.
  During the masterâ€™s course, I carried out an external internship at the laboratory of medical oncology, clinical translational and immunotherapy of San Raffaele Hospital and I collaborated with Cancer Research UK Cambridge Center (CRUK Center) under the supervision of Dr. Giampaolo Bianchini and Dr. Maurizio Callari, respectively.
  After my masterâ€™s degree, I worked as bioinformatician in an extracurricular traineeship at Michelangelo Foundation. Some abstracts were written and approved to different poster discussions. In particular, two of them have been presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 2021 and on July 2022 another important work was presented at European Association for Cancer Reseatch Conference at Oxford.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the deconvolution method applied to bulk tumour samples, longitudinal clustering and methods to discover biomarkers in breast cancer.
